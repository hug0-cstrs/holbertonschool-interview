# Array to AVL

Given a sorted array, convert it into a height-balanced binary search tree (BST).

A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

## Example

```plaintext
Input: [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```
